Apache NiFi is a Real Time Data Collection and Dataflow Management. Hortonworks DataFlow is a single combined platform which provides the data acquisition, simple event processing, transport and delivery mechanism designed to accommodate the highly diverse and complicated dataflows generated by a world of connected people, systems and things.

#### What is data provenance?
Provenance is defined as the place of origin or earliest known history of some thing. In the context of a dataflow, data provenance is the ability to trace the path of a piece of data within a dataflow from its place of creation, through to its final destination. Within Hortonworks DataFlow data provenance provides the ability to visually verify where data came from, how it was used, who viewed it, whether it was sent, copied, transformed or received. Any system or person who came in contact with a specific piece of data is captured in its completeness in terms of time, date, action, precedents and dependents for a complete picture of the chain of custody for that precise piece of data within a dataflow. This provenance metadata information is used to support data sharing compliance requirements as well as for dataflow tuning, trouble-shooting and optimization.
