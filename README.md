Apache NiFi is a Real Time Data Collection and Dataflow Management. Hortonworks DataFlow is a single combined platform which provides the data acquisition, simple event processing, transport and delivery mechanism designed to accommodate the highly diverse and complicated dataflows generated by a world of connected people, systems and things.

Hortonworks Data Flow User Guide is available in Docs folder

Alternatively you download the same from http://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDF1/HDF-1.1.1/bk_UserGuide/bk_UserGuide-20151229.pdf


#### What is data provenance?
Provenance is defined as the place of origin or earliest known history of some thing. In the context of a dataflow, data provenance is the ability to trace the path of a piece of data within a dataflow from its place of creation, through to its final destination. Within Hortonworks DataFlow data provenance provides the ability to visually verify where data came from, how it was used, who viewed it, whether it was sent, copied, transformed or received. Any system or person who came in contact with a specific piece of data is captured in its completeness in terms of time, date, action, precedents and dependents for a complete picture of the chain of custody for that precise piece of data within a dataflow. This provenance metadata information is used to support data sharing compliance requirements as well as for dataflow tuning, trouble-shooting and optimization.

###### FlowFile:
Each piece of "User Data" (i.e., data that the user brings into NiFi for processing and distribution) is referred to as a FlowFile. A FlowFile is made up of two parts: Attributes and Content. The Content is the User Data itself. Attributes are key-value pairs that are associated with the User Data.
###### Processor:
The Processor is the NiFi component that is responsible for creating, sending, receiving, transforming, routing, splitting, merging, and processing FlowFiles. It is the most important building block available to NiFi users to build their dataflows.

###### NiFi Installation

Mac OSX users may use the tarball or can install via Homebrew.
To install via Homebrew, simply run the command
```
brew install nifi
```

Starting NiFi on OSX:
To run NiFi in the foreground, run
```
bin/nifi.sh run
```
This will leave the application running until the user presses Ctrl-C
To run NiFi in the background, instead run
```
bin/nifi.sh start
bin/nifi.sh status
bin/nifi.sh stop
```
Installing as a Service: Currently, installing NiFi as a service is supported only for Linux and Mac OSX users
```
bin/nifi.sh install
sudo service nifi start
service nifi status
sudo service nifi stop
```
To get started, open a web browser and navigate to
```
http://localhost:8080/nifi
```
The port can be changed by editing the nifi.properties file in the NiFi conf directory, but the default port is 8080
